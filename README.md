# Phishing Nuke
 
An upgraded script based off nitsuga5124's version, designed to taint a phishing scam's data to a point of having to toss large amounts of it.

Go pay nitsuga5124 some love on his GitLab. https://gitlab.com/nitsuga5124

## Usage
I'll admit, it's not super easy to use, but I kinda tried. 

Each login page has an 'auth url'. This can be found by opening the networking tab on your browser's debugging tools and filling in bogus information then clicking 'login'. You'll see a POST request with your information in the headers. Copy that URL and paste it in the `authurl` on line 7.

Then, fill out the headers from lines 20 onwards. Examples included are 'login' and 'password'. The first listed is the name of the header, and the second is the variable sent up. 

You figure it out from here. I'm tired and it's just filling out the headers from lines 20 on. 

Included are sets of 10,000 fake names, usernames, passwords, credit card numbers along with expirations, and addresses all generated by fakenamegenerator.com. You can use those or punch in your own. 

## Downfalls
    1. Each request comes from the same IP, be that yours or a VPN's.
    2. You can't screw with time... At least without causing issues.
        * Someone running the scam can simply delete all info from after a given time to remove the tainted data from you.
